RTX51 Tiny Project Configuration Instructions
=============================================

To properly configure your Keil uVision project for RTX51 Tiny, follow these steps:

1. Project Settings:
   - Open your project in Keil uVision
   - Go to Project -> Options for Target
   - Under the "Target" tab, ensure:
     * Set your memory model to "Small" (for RTX51 Tiny)
     * Set proper crystal frequency for timer calculations

2. Include Paths:
   - Go to "C/C++" tab
   - Add the RTX51 Tiny library path to "Include Paths"
   - Typically located at: C:\Keil\C51\RTX51TNY\INC

3. Library Configuration:
   - Go to "C/C++" tab
   - Check "RTX51 Tiny" in the library selection
   - Or manually add: RTX51TNY.LIB to your project

4. Configuration File:
   - Make sure conf_tny.A51 is included in your project
   - This file contains the RTX51 Tiny kernel configuration

5. Memory Settings:
   - Under "Memory Model" tab, select "Small" model
   - RTX51 Tiny is designed for small memory model

6. Build Options:
   - Make sure "Create Hex File" is checked under "Output" tab
   - This ensures proper linking with RTX51 Tiny kernel

7. Important Notes:
   - The RTX51 Tiny kernel uses Timer 0 by default for system tick
   - Make sure Timer 0 is not used by your application
   - The system tick interval is configured in conf_tny.A51 (default 10ms)

Your main.c file has been properly configured with:
- Four tasks (Task 0-3) using the _task_ keyword
- Proper RTX51 Tiny function calls (os_create_task, os_wait, etc.)
- System initialization with os_start_system()
